This was because the algorithm was fully traversing down/up the SVO for nodes behind me! Leaf nodes that get rendered are only in front of the camera, so there was no sense in searching for leaf nodes we would never render anyway. To account for this, I added a check that prevents the algorithm from travelling down the octree if the node is completely behind the camera. It will only traverse down if the camera is inside the node or the node is in front of the camera. Effectively, it treats nodes behind the camera as being empty and skips over them.
