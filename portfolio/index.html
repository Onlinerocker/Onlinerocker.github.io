	<h2>UltraStack (Unity3D/C#)</h2>
	<img src="../ultra stack.jpg" width="202.5" height="416.25">
	
	<p>
	UltraStack is a casual mobile game where the player attempts to stack blocks as high as possible.
	I finished development and released the game on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in early 2019. 
	The app has been archived
	and is no longer available, but you can download the PC version below. It was developed using Unity3D
	and C#.

	<h2>Spline Curve Editor/Interpolator (C++)</h2>
	<img src="spline.png" width="400" height=300">
	
	<p>
	This spline curve editor was created during my Computer Animation course at Swarthmore College.
	The goal was to create an interactive way to learn about different types of splines/interpolation.
	I implemented functions to calculate control points for Catmul-Rom and Hermite Splines respectively.
	Additionally, I developed functions to interpolate a point across each spline.

	<h2>Inverse Kinematics Demos (C++)</h2>
	<img src="ik.png" width="400" height=300">
	<p>
	I implemented an analytical method of IK on a
	two-link. Additionally, I developed a function which enables a skeleton to "look at" a moving target point.

	Controls: </br>	
	Left-button drag with the mouse to rotate</br>
        Right-button drag with the mouse to pan</br>
        Middle-button drag with the mouse to zoom</br>
        'f' button will focus the view on the character

	<h2>Raymarched Cel-Shaded Primitives (GLSL)</h2>
	<iframe width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" src="https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/wtcGDj?gui=true&t=10&paused=true&muted=false" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	
	<p>	
	These primitives are rendered in real-time entirely within a GLSL pixel shader.
	This is a achieved through an algorithm known as Raymarching. Put simply, rays are marched in the 
	direction of each pixel from
	the camera's eye until they intersect with an object. Upon intersection, color is calculated using a lighting
	equation. In this case, colors are restricted to discrete color "bands". This achieves the "cel-shaded"
    	lighting aesthetic.	Intersection is determined by signed-distance functions (often abbreviated SDF). For more information,
	check out the source code below.
