	<h2>Raymarched Cel-Shaded Primitives User Guide</h2>

	<p>	
	These primitives are rendered in real-time entirely within a GLSL pixel shader.
	This is a achieved through an algorithm known as Raymarching. Put simply, rays are marched in the 
	direction of each pixel from
	the camera's eye until they intersect with an object. Upon intersection, color is calculated using a lighting
	equation. In this case, colors are restricted to discrete color "bands". This achieves the "cel-shaded"
    	lighting aesthetic.	Intersection is determined by signed-distance functions (often abbreviated SDF). For more information,
	check out the source code below.

	<h3>How to Use</h3>
	<p>
	Since the image above is rendered in real time, you can interact with it using the controls below. Clicking the <i>play</i>
	button will cause the camera to automatically rotate around the scene.
