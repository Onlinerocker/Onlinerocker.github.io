	<h2>UltraStack User Guide</h2>
	
	<p>
	UltraStack is a casual mobile game where the player attempts to stack blocks as high as possible.
	I finished development and released the game on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in early 2019. 
	The app has been archived
	and is no longer available, but you can download the PC version below. It was developed using Unity3D
	and C#.
	</p>

	<p>
	The goal of UltraStack is to stack a tower as high as possible. Your score is equal to your towers height, so
	you want to stack as high as possible. However, if your tower falls over, you lose the game. Thus, you want to
	create a tower that is both stable and tall.
