	<h2>UltraStack User Guide</h2>
	
	<p>
	UltraStack is a casual mobile game where the player attempts to stack blocks as high as possible.
	I finished development and released the game on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in early 2019. 
	The app has been archived
	and is no longer available, but you can download the PC version below. It was developed using Unity3D
	and C#.
	</p>

	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
	Follow the build instructions on <a href="https://github.com/Onlinerocker/UltraStack">GitHub</a> or download the executable <a href="../downloads/ultra_stack.zip">here</a>.
	</p>

	

	<h3>How to Play</h3>
	<p>
	The goal of UltraStack is to create the tallest tower possible. A player's score is equal to the tower's height. 
	However, the game utilizes the Havoc physics engine, making it possible for an unstable tower to fall over.
	If the tower falls over, the game ends. The most successful towers have a balance of stability and height.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Controls</h3>
	<p>
	Use the <i>left</i> and <i>right</i> arrow keys to move a block left and right, respectively. To make a block
	drop faster, hold the <i>down</i> arrow key.
	To rotate a block, tap the <i>Z</i> key.
