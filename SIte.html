	<h2>Spline Curve Editor/Interpolator</h2>
	<img src="spline.gif" width="220" height=220">
	
	<p>
	This spline curve editor was created for one of my Computer Animation labs at Swarthmore College.
	I implemented functions to calculate control points for Catmul-Rom and Hermite Splines respectively.
	Additionally, I developed functions to interpolate a point across each spline.

	<h2>Raymarched Cel-Shaded Primitives (comment me plz)</h2>

	<p>	
	These primitives are rendered in real-time entirely within a GLSL pixel shader.
	This is a achieved through an algorithm known as Raymarching. Put simply, rays are marched in the 
	direction of each pixel from
	the camera's eye until they intersect with an object. Upon intersection, color is calculated using a lighting
	equation. In this case, colors are restricted to discrete color "bands". This achieves the "cel-shaded"
    lighting aesthetic.	Intersection is determined by signed-distance functions (often abbreviated SDF). For more information,
	check out the source code below.
